### Step 1: Scrape Your Classes

You can scrape SPARKS in **two ways**:

#### 1. Manual Method

1. Open `browserInject.js` and copy its contents.
2. Navigate to the SPARKS page with your desired classes.
3. Press `F12` or right-click ‚Üí **Inspect** to open Developer Tools.
4. Paste the code into the browser's console.
5. A pop-up will appear asking you to name the JSON file. For example, name it `Engineering`.
6. A file named `Engineering.json` will be downloaded to your **Downloads** folder.

#### 2. Bookmark Method (Recommended)

1. Run `converter.py` to convert `browserInject.js` into a bookmarklet.
2. Save the bookmarklet as a bookmark.
3. Navigate to the SPARKS page where your classes are displayed.
4. Press the bookmarklet.
5. A pop-up will appear asking you to name the JSON file. For example, `Engineering`.
6. The JSON file will be downloaded to your **Downloads** folder.

4. Select the JSON file you downloaded. Your class list will appear on the right.
